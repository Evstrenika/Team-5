TERRI
  1: Kevin
    -wants app for motorcyclists
    -a way to meet up with other riders, and to review roads/routes
    -can warn about dangerous roads (e.g. slippery corners, bad blind spots, etc)
    -gives weather and road conditions with motorcycles in mind (e.g. wwet road might still be safe for cars but not bikes)
    -suggests routes which avoid poorly rated roads

  2: Emily
    -finds it hard to start projects without pressure/stress
    -writing lists helps sometimes, but 'reminders' app isn't good enough because user has to set reminders themselves and there
    are no consequences if user doesn't follow through
    -app should make it easy to when tasks need to be completed and have consequences

  3: Elizabeth
    -struggles to balance work, uni, and social life
    -wants an app that colour-coordinates calendar by category (work/study/social) and gives notification about timetable clashes
    -ability to sync between platforms
    -currently uses calendar app, but there's no easy alert for clashes, so it's possible to accidentally double-book

  4: Kim
    -wants an easy to rearrange calendar app
    -has health issues, so schedule can change without warning. Rearranging study plan to make up for lost days is time-consuming
    and difficult
    -most current options only support event editing (see Windows Calendar), which means it's easier to simply delete the events entirely
    and start fresh. This wastes time
    -wants to be able to simply drag and drop events from old plan to fresh plan

  5: Sarah
    -wants an app which helps to break down tasks into manageable chunks
    -app should set due dates for 'chunks' to help complete task before actual due date
    -include an easy way to invite someone to study with the user - this gives incentive to go somewhere without distractions and work
    on the task

VERONIKA

    Jenna
        •	Finds it hard to manage her relationships
        •	She wants reminders to send messages to people with a frequency based on 
        how familiar she is with them
        •	She wants a way to keep track of things people have done that she didn’t 
        like and what attempts she has made to communicate with them about it
        •	This is so that she can get reminders that a relationship might not be super healthy
        •	Ideally, she would want it to be integrated with her messaging platform of 
        choice to provide statistics about her chats with people
        •	This is so that she can notice when relationships are really one sided or how 
        long on average she can put off responding to someone

    Chris
        •	Finds it hard to remember his friend’s timetables
        •	He wants an app that can show him where his and his friend’s timetables overlap, 
        and when he can meet up with his group mates to work on projects
        •	He thinks integrating an assignment tracker would be useless as he already has a 
        calendar app to manage his assignments
        •	He also thinks including a timetable planner would be a waste as there already 
        exists one for his university
        •	He would like an app to also be able to modify his timetables in case he can’t 
        attend classes so that time can be freed up and other group mates/friends know about his availability changes
        •	He would like it to include work, volunteer and university schedules
        Extra idea/problem space
        •	He finds it difficult to use his phone for everyday tasks
        •	He would really like an app that could display the screen content of his phone on his laptop, 
        like that of chrome cast with phones to TVs

    Lara
        •	As a freelance personal trainer, she finds it a bit inconvenient to find and have 
        each of her clients call her up to book a session with her
        •	She also finds it difficult to travel to her clients if they are located very far away 
        •	She wants an app that she can use for clients to easily find her, book time slots 
        with her and find her depending on how close she lives to them
        •	She also wants to be able to view her competition in the area so that she can 
        promote herself better if she needs or offer sales to attract new clients
        •	She would like to list her skill set on the app, her location, her prices, her offers, 
        her events (such as boot camps) and social media pages (as to be able to advertise herself)
        •	She would also like to keep a list of her existing and new clients to be able to send 
        them messages about sessions if they haven’t booked with her in a while

ALLY

Bec:
-	Wants app to help her manage her assignment due dates with weekly checklists
-	Remind her to get little bits done each week, a way to break down assignments
-	Also an app that can set to-do lists, with to do and done categories maybe even an in progress

-	Having to use different calendar apps for work, uni, family, social is too difficult
-	Wants a calendar that syncs all her commitments in one place that is easy to manipulate and understand
-	She uses the apple calendar app but finds it hard to manage the multiple different calendars (importing from QUT site for example) because it downloads all events instead of the ones she wants

Lauren:
-	Wants an app that can help time management
-	Finds listing a good suggestion, also having a create your own work/study timetable helps

-	Also a way to break assignments into manageable chuncks, with reminders per week/per couple of days to complete them

Jess:

-	Maybe tracks her progress in certain units and if she hits a certain GPA or score then she gets a reward
