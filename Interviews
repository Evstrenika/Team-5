TERRI
  1: Kevin
    -wants app for motorcyclists
    -a way to meet up with other riders, and to review roads/routes
    -can warn about dangerous roads (e.g. slippery corners, bad blind spots, etc)
    -gives weather and road conditions with motorcycles in mind (e.g. wwet road might still be safe for cars but not bikes)
    -suggests routes which avoid poorly rated roads

  2: Emily
    -finds it hard to start projects without pressure/stress
    -writing lists helps sometimes, but 'reminders' app isn't good enough because user has to set reminders themselves and there
    are no consequences if user doesn't follow through
    -app should make it easy to when tasks need to be completed and have consequences

  3: Elizabeth
    -struggles to balance work, uni, and social life
    -wants an app that colour-coordinates calendar by category (work/study/social) and gives notification about timetable clashes
    -ability to sync between platforms
    -currently uses calendar app, but there's no easy alert for clashes, so it's possible to accidentally double-book

  4: Kim
    -wants an easy to rearrange calendar app
    -has health issues, so schedule can change without warning. Rearranging study plan to make up for lost days is time-consuming
    and difficult
    -most current options only support event editing (see Windows Calendar), which means it's easier to simply delete the events entirely
    and start fresh. This wastes time
    -wants to be able to simply drag and drop events from old plan to fresh plan

  5: Sarah
    -wants an app which helps to break down tasks into manageable chunks
    -app should set due dates for 'chunks' to help complete task before actual due date
    -include an easy way to invite someone to study with the user - this gives incentive to go somewhere without distractions and work
    on the task
